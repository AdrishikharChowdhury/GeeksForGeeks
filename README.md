# GeeksForGeeks

This repository contains my solutions to various problems from GeeksforGeeks.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- Each problem has its own folder named after the problem title or a shortened version of it.
- Inside each folder, you'll find:
  - The solution file(s) (e.g., `solution.cpp`, `solution.py`, etc.)
  - A `README.md` file containing the problem statement and any additional notes

## Languages

Solutions are primarily written in the following languages:
- Java
(Add or remove languages as applicable)

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the specific problem folder you're interested in.
2. Read the `README.md` file for the problem statement and any notes.
3. Check the solution file for the implementation.
